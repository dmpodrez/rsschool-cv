## About Myself:

At this point, I've learned HTML,CSS, and PHP. Now I devote time to JavaScript and its more in- depth study. At the moment, I have a project related to UberEats and am engaged in its "revival". I have work experience about 1 year, but, unfortunately, it is not related to IT. However, I learned to work in a team and felt through myself what it means to work by hands. I am stress-resistant, attentive, purposeful, always set goals and achieve them, I like to put myself in a strict framework.
